# Orama CAN 
Orama CAN is a project that aims to make use of a type of deep learning model: CAN 
(Creative Adversarial Network) to generate original images by combining different 
styles of training images. Below is an example:

Samples from CAN after 80-100 epoch. Each epoch is roughly of 40 hours' running time on a supercomputer.<br /><br />

## GAN
CycleGAN Style transfer: each style is trained with around 1500 images<br />
